2020 Case Competition at the Martin J. Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University.

The solution of Case Competition contains the details about how we reached the conclusion, assumptions, etc. 

In this case, we are going to give an analysis of Fancam's business situation and give them possible solutions to help re-boosting their sales and increase efficiency within the company. 

As a South African company, Fancam sold its innovative high-definition, 360-degree crowd images for huge gathering events, however, they have suffered from continuous decline of sales since 2013. 

In the first part, we are going to conduct a SWOT analysis and competitor analysis to have a general review of their business and operations. In the second part, we are going to focus on the methods of sales-boosting by expanding market segments as well as improving product strategies. Last but not least, we make some suggestions to help them improve their channel management strategy including 3 parts: incentive strategy, reseller management and in-house sales capability, to keep a sustainable global business.
